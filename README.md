## About
**RestAPI** that can send and receive Whatsapp messages through ***[ChatAPI](https://chat-api.com/)***, a *Whatsapp API gateway*.

>*This project's purpose is to demonstrate some of my Java and ReactJs skills.*

<br />

  - Spring Boot
    - Spring Web
    - Spring Data
    - OpenAPI (Swagger)
  - Maven

 (exposes a local web server to the internet so I can receive data from ChatAPI. Also, it lets you inspect HTTP traffic)  
 
<br />

## Things to do next:
- [ ] Integrate Google Drive API to store sent/received files on Google Drive.
